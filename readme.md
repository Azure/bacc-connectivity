[Azure Batch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-technical-overview)
is a service for running compute intensive workloads on Azure. It provides a managed service for running
jobs on a pool of compute nodes. The service is designed to be highly scalable and can be used to run jobs that
require hundreds or thousands of compute nodes. The service is also designed to be highly customizable and can be
used to run a wide variety of workloads. Getting started with Azure Batch is easy. The service can be used to run jobs
in a matter of minutes. Getting a proof-of-concept (POC) that demonstrates the value of the service is also easy.
However, as one moves from a POC to a production deployment, by incorporating best practices and security guidelines,
the complexity of the deployment invariably increases.

This repository is a part of our accelerator solution to make it easier for customers to deploy **Azure Batch** workloads
in a manner that follows best practices and security guidelines. When used in conjunction with the Azure Batch starter repository [azbatch-starter](https://github.com/utkarshayachit/azbatch-starter), it can be used to deploy
a locked down Azure Batch environment, designed for industrial use cases such as those in Financial Services (FSI).

This repository is part one of two repositories aming to speed-up the depoloyment of (secured) Azure Batch, but can also be used to deploy a simplified connectitivty zone for secure sandbox deployments, pilots and similar projects. For a large scale, enterprise ready landing zone, we recommend to follow the guiding principles and recommendations found in the [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/#platform-vs-application-landing-zones).
